# BungeePackets
==========
An in depth packet library for BungeeCord. This library allows developers to create plugins that allow for inventories across server networks, play sounds, particle effects, and soon to be lots more!
Usage
-------
BungeePackets adds in one simple event to manage packets. PacketEvent. The packet event is used to manage all incoming and outcoming packets. With every incoming and outcoming packet there is a player assigned to it somewhere in the pipe. Using this you can differentiate wheather a server is sending a packet to BungeeCord, vice-versa.
